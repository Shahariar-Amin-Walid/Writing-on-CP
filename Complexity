Today I want to write about time complexity and Memory complexity.
Time complexity is a relative thing.When we run a program we can find some information like the lines following...
Process exited after 2.018 seconds with return value 0
Press any key to continue . . .
One can think that I run a program thats time complexity is 2.018.....but NO!
here,2.018s is called execution time.time complexity represents an idea about the effectiveness of out program.It can be 
express by BIG O NOTETION...O(something...).
I don't wanna discuss about the basic of time complexity.Now I discuss about the time complexity of the following program..
1+(1+2)+(1+2+3)+....(1+2+3+...+n)=?
C++ code for the program is...
//code_01_never_give_up...

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main( )
{
	cout<<"Enter the value of n: ";
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	int sum=0;
	     for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
	         for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
	            sum+=j;
	cout<<sum<<endl;
	return 0;
}
    Here we use a nested loop.The outer loop runs n time and the inner loop runs i time,
So the complexity would be O(n*i);
We calculate complexity for the worst case.
In worst case i=n;
so the complexity = O(n^2);
if(n==1000) n^2=10^6;
A pc can calculate 10^8 bytes/sec.So the program runs well.But if n==100000,then n^2=10^10...It takes many time to 
give us the output.In CP we get TLE verdict!So we have to less the complexity.If we use the formula of summation of
1 to n natural numbers,the program will be....
 
//code_02_never_give_up...

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main( )
{
	cout<<"Enter the value of n: ";
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	int sum=0;
	     for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
	         sum+=(i+i*i)/2;
	cout<<sum<<endl;
	return 0;
}
Here we use a loop and a formula,The loop's complexity is O(n) and formula's complexity is O(1).So the toeal complexity 
is O(n).Its good for the input 10^8.What happen if our input will be 10^12?We further get TLE verdict.So its not 
fully effective.
So we have to less the complexity ...
See the following code...
//code_03_never_give_up...

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main( )
{
	cout<<"Enter the value of n: ";
	int n;
	cin>>n;
    float sum;
    float n1=n;
    sum=(n1*(n1+1)/4) + (n1*(n1+1)*(2*n1+1)/12);
    cout<<sum<<endl;
	return 0;
}
Here we use only one formula.So our complexity is O(1).Its fully effective.
Here we use float to avoid the precision error.

Now I discuss about Memory Complexity.
How much memory is taken by our program is memory complexity.
If we use 4/5 variables/constants,we dont have to think about memory complexity.
We have to be careful when we use array,string,vector,set,map etc...
see and try to understaand the following line carefully to know the calculation of memory limit.
Let,We use an array a[10^6];the data type of the array is integer.
We know an integer takes 4 bytes memory.So the array takes 4x10^6 bytes memory.
we know 1 kilobytes = 1024 bytes.
        1 megabytes = 1024 kilobytes 
                    = 1024X1024 Kb
                    = 1048576 Kb
 so the total memry needed for the array is(4X10^6)/1048576 =3.81 Mb
If the memory limit of our program is 256 MB(most of the cases),no problem...
Let we have to use an integer type vector of 10^8 size.
The total memry needed for the array is(4X10^8)/1048576 =381.46 Mb>256MB
So,we get MLE verdict!.
Thats all for today...
